# CPMA
 _A congestion propagation model based on Markov chain._

## Features


- [x] determine the minimum expected propagation for each road segments involved in the congestion propagation.
- [x] if a road segment is in involved in different congestion propagation paths, just get the minimum expected time.  


## Installation
requirements
```python
python 3.7 and up
```


The most common way to use  **CPMA**  is to install it from source and modify the source code directly:

```python
git clone https://github.com/Metro1998/CPMA
```
### Usage


```python
to do
```

## To Do List
- [ ] different time_particles
- [ ] some congestion trees can't be resolved.
